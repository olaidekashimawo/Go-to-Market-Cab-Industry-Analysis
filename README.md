Go-to-Market Cab Industry Analysis

This project involves analyzing data from two cab companies to understand the demand for cab services, the relationship between population and number of cab users, and the profitability of the companies.

Data
The data used in this analysis includes four individual data sets spanning from January 31, 2016 to December 31, 2018:

Cab_Data.csv: includes details of transactions for two cab companies
Customer_ID.csv: a mapping table containing a unique identifier that links the customerâ€™s demographic details
Transaction_ID.csv: a mapping table containing transaction to customer mapping and payment mode
City.csv: a list of US cities, their population, and number of cab users
Hypotheses
The following hypotheses were formulated for this analysis:

The demand for cab services is positively correlated with the population of the city.
The profit margin increases with an increase in the number of customers.
The profit margin varies with the city.
Analysis
The analysis was performed in Python, using Pandas for data manipulation and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

The analysis involved:

Data cleaning and preparation, which involved merging the four data sets and ensuring data consistency and completeness.
Exploratory data analysis, which involved visualizing the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
Hypothesis testing, which involved statistical analysis to test the hypotheses formulated.
Conclusion and recommendations, which involved summarizing the findings and making recommendations based on the results.
Results and Recommendations
The results of the analysis showed that there is a positive correlation between the population of a city and the number of cab users, supporting the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis, that the profit margin increases with an increase in the number of customers, was also supported by the data. Finally, the third hypothesis was confirmed, showing that the profit margin varies with the city.

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made:

Cab companies should focus their marketing and expansion efforts on cities with higher populations to increase demand for their services.
Cab companies should aim to increase their customer base to increase profitability. This can be achieved by offering promotions and incentives to attract new customers and retain existing ones.
Cab companies should conduct a market analysis to identify cities with the highest profit margins and focus on expanding their operations in those areas.

Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into the demand for cab services, the relationship between population and number of cab users, and the profitability of cab companies. The recommendations provided can be used by cab companies to optimize their operations and increase profitability.
